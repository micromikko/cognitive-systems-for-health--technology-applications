# Machine learning repository
   
This repository was created to showcase a selection of lab excercises and mini-projects (cases 1, 2, and 3) for the machine learning courses *Cognitive Systems for Health Technology Applications* and *Cognitive Systems Mathematics*.
   
All work was done using the Keras framework on top of Tensorflow. The notebook files are in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb), while trained models are available as .h5 files.
